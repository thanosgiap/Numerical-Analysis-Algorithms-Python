# Numerical-Analysis-Algorithms-Python

### This is the first part of a Python project that I made in my third semester of studies. <br> It implements various Numerical Analysis Algorithms in Python.
#### First Exercise:
This Python file contains the implementation of three approximative root finding functions, as well a simple function that plots the given function.
<br>
Following the order that I coded them these are Bisection, Newton-Raphson and Secant. <br>
By giving correct starting and ending points to each function they can calculate the approximation of the root as well as the loops that took them to find it.
<br>
#### Second Exercise:
This file implements the three previous functions but with small alterations to the way that they work. <br>
For example the original Bisection algorithm always picks as the next point the middle of the previous two. My altered version instead picks a random point
inside the searching area.
<br>
#### Third Exercise:
This Python file implements matrix associative algorithms. <br>
Following the order that I coded them these are PA-LU decomposition, Cholesky decomposition and Gauss-Siedel.
<br>
#### Fourth Exercise:
In this Python I analyze a 15x15 2-dimensional matrix which represents a small portion of the Google's web. <br>
Technique's such as eigenvalues, eigenvectors and an algorithm called Power Methos are used to break down the "web" in order to 
exctract informations about it.
